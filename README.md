This is a website for displaying the third version of the book catalog. It uses a JSON file to render the list of books and displays the book price instead of the author. In this version, the Add button is active and opens a modal form for creating a new book, including fields for title, author, publisher, publication year, language, and pages, with the form closing upon submission. The Book component has been updated to include a remove button to delete a book from the page and a visual indicator for selected books, such as a prominent border or background, which can be toggled off by clicking again.
